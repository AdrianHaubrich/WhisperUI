# WhisperUI
Supports highly accurate, automatic voice-to-text transcriptions. All transcriptions are done locally on the device. 

The app also offers an intuitive user interface to edit the transcripts. 
Transcripts are stored locally using SwiftData.

## Status: WIP
Please keep in mind that this project is currently work-in-progress. While creating and editing transcriptions is possible, there are a few bugs, visual issues, and missing features.

This is an **early WIP preview version**.

## Supported platforms
Currently, the app only runs on macOS.

Most of the codebase is written in SwiftUI in an apple-platform agnostic way. Therefore the app should run on other apple platforms like iOS - with some UI adjustments.

## What about speaker diarization?
Automatic speaker diarization is currently not supported. There are plans to add this feature later.
